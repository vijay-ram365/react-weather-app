React weather app w/ open weather API


This is technically my second attempt at creating a weather app, but my first utlizing React and the Open Weather API.

Creating a weather app is an excellent challenge to solidify skills as a developer, as usual, this project was created with no tutorial and lots
of research (thanks Google.) 

In this project I have attempted to gain further understanding of JavaScript Promises, Fetch, and functions while also expanding my 
knowledge of the React Hook useState and overall React functional components.
